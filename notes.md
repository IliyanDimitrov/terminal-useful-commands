To save files in Ubuntu for Windows env directly through VS Code certain permissions are required.

 Use the command for the folder you are working in: `sudo chown -R username:username ../folder/` 
`username:username` need to be replaced with your username. To see it you can use the `whoami` command in the terminal.
